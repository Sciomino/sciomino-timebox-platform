xcow_b is installed in a few steps, the mainly involve configuring apache, php and mysql.

1. unpack the source
2. set permissions
3. setup apache
4. setup php.ini
5. setup mysql
6. configure xcow_b
7. initialize the database


1. unpack the source
====================

Unpack the distribution for example in directory /data/www/xcow_b
The following files will be available
- INSTALL.txt, this file
- README.txt, the file you already read ;-)
- cgi-bin, the script directory for apache
- data, the data directory, with all important stuff
- export, the directory where new builds endup
- htdocs, the document root directory for apache, where it can read
- license, the license
- save, a directory where apache can write stuff
- scripts, a directory with not web related stuff like: db, cron, deployment and unittest.
- version, the current version of the software

2. set permissions
==================

- make sure the subdirectories in directory 'save' are readable and writeable for apache. Do something like:
  - cd scripts/deployment
  - run: setPermissions.sh


3. setup apache
===============

make a new virtual host on apache and point the document root to the htdocs directory.

Make sure the following directove is set:
- AcceptPathInfo On

??? Timeout limit!!! default is 300 seconds

4. setup php.ini
================

there is a filesize limit for uploads in the xcow_b config.
make sure the config in the php.ini does allow this size.

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 200M
post_max_size = 200M

??? this is not necessary yet!!! maybe this is not script execution time, but execution time by the system.
make sure there is enough time to process this amount of data:
max_execution_time = 300 (in php.ini)
OR set_time_limit(300) (in script) 

300 is same value as apache timeout!

5. setup mysql
==============

create a new database and make it accesible for user DB_USER with password DB_PASS.

mysql> create database DB_NAME
mysql> grant all on DB_NAME.* to 'DB_USER'@'localhost' identified by 'DB_PASS';
mysql> flush privileges;

6. configure xcow_b
===================

Goto the directory 'data/etc' and edit the xcow_b.ini file. probably the only section that needs to be editted is 'the database' section. Please, suplly the information you used to setup the mysql database.

7. initialize the database
==========================

Goto the directory 'scripts/db'

run> mysql -u DB_USER -p DB_NAME < create.sql


Off We Go!
